# nf-core/dualrnaseq

## Introduction

Dualrnaseq is a workflow designed to assist in separating host and pathogen sequencing data. This has been initially tested with hosts including Human and Mouse, but can be used for any host organism containing a reference and annotation. The same input applies for extracting the pathogen information, thereby making this pipeline suited to a wide range of host and pathogen datasets.

This has been built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), a workflow tool allowing scalable and reproducible workflows using containers, which can run across multiple computing infrastructures.

The workflow diagram below gives a simplified visual overview of how dualrnaseq has been designed.
